Currently, I’m not allowed to share the raw data, which is why they’re not on the Github repo yet. 2.1 Read waves 2-6 We’ll start with loading the data for waves 2 to 6. We start here instead of wave 1 because participant identification isn’t super straightforward. A participant doesn’t get a single unique identifier that’s stable across all waves. Instead, participants start with an ID in wave 1 (called transaction_idOld in the wave 2 to 6 data) and get a new unique ID for wave 2 and so on. I believe originally the researchers wanted to go with a single ID, but changed their mind. Look at the data table below (2.1), where I made up two participants to recreate the data structure. We see that the first participant has an transaction ID (transaction_idOld) for the first wave. The same participant then has that same old transaction ID for wave two, plus a new transaction ID for wave 2 (transaction_id). Here’s where it gets a bit complicated: That transaction ID for wave 2 is repeated on wave 3, but with a different name (transaction_idW2). Next to that new variable, is the unique ID for that wave (transaction_idW3). After that, each new wave has the ID of the previous wave plus a new ID for the current wave. Table 2.1: Example of how ID variables look like id transaction_old transaction_id transaction_idW2 transaction_idW3 transaction_idW4 transaction_idW5 transaction_idW6 week 1 978344791 NA NA NA NA NA NA 1 1 978344791 987910814 NA NA NA NA NA 2 1 NA NA 987910814 994717737 NA NA NA 3 1 NA NA NA 994717737 998317051 NA NA 4 1 NA NA NA NA 998317051 1005222579 NA 5 1 NA NA NA NA NA 1005222579 1018946937 6 2 978344792 NA NA NA NA NA NA 1 2 978344792 987910815 NA NA NA NA NA 2 2 NA NA 987910815 NA NA NA NA 3 2 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 4 2 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 5 2 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 6 Unfortunately, the id column from the example isn’t included in the raw data, so we’ll have to recreate participant IDs that are constant across waves. I solved this problem with a loop, which is definitely not the most elegant way to go about this, but I think it gets the job done. First, lets load the data. waves_2_to_6 &lt;- read_csv( here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;waves_2_to_6.csv&quot;), guess_max = 2e4 ) Next, the logic behind assigning the constant IDs. We’ll start at the ID of wave 2, find the ID of wave 3 that’s on the same line as the ID of wave 2 and store the ID for wave 3. We repeat this procedure for all waves and in the end assign an ID to those rows that have the IDs we extracted on any of the ID variables. The steps, concretely: We store all IDs (so that’s the IDs of wave 2) in a vector (excluding NAs). Initiate an ID counter (i.e., the participant number we assign later). We iterate over each wave 2 ID. If participants did participate in a wave, we find the wave 3 ID that is on the same row as the wave 2 that we’re currently looking for. We now look for the wave 3 ID and store the wave 4 ID that’s on the same line. We repeat that until we’re at the last ID and have all IDs for that participant stored in a vector. Then a row gets assigned the participant ID (to the existing, but empty id variable) if any of the wave ID variables have a match in the extracted IDs. On my machine, the below code takes about three minutes. # the unique wave 2 IDs ids &lt;- waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% pull(transaction_id) %&gt;% na.omit # the participant number we assign later id_counter &lt;- 1 # assign the correct variable type to the empty ID variable that&#39;s already in the data where we&#39;ll assign participant numbers at the end of the loop waves_2_to_6$id &lt;- NA_real_ for (an_id in ids) { # transaction ids that belong to that one participant id_to_match &lt;- c() # add the initial id id_to_match &lt;- c(id_to_match, an_id) # assign that id as temporary ID for which we should match (id_to_match only has one entry so far) temp_id &lt;- id_to_match # at this point, participants might have not participated in the next wave, so they might have an empty cell in # transaction_id2. so we&#39;ll embed everything that follows in their separate if statement if (!is_empty(temp_id)) { # find the transcation_id3 that&#39;s on the same line as transaction_id2 and store it temp_id &lt;- waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% filter(transaction_idW2 == an_id) %&gt;% pull(transaction_idW3) id_to_match &lt;- na.omit(c(id_to_match, temp_id)) # so that NA doesn&#39;t become one of the IDs } if (!is_empty(temp_id)){ # then the same for transaction_id4, but this time we compare to the temporary id we extracted above # also, we only select those rows where the next ID isn&#39;t NA (because there&#39;re two matches for the temp_id) temp_id &lt;- waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% filter((transaction_idW3 == temp_id) &amp; !is.na(transaction_idW4)) %&gt;% pull(transaction_idW4) id_to_match &lt;- c(id_to_match, temp_id) } if (!is_empty(temp_id)){ # then the same as above for transaction_id5 temp_id &lt;- waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% filter((transaction_idW4 == temp_id) &amp; !is.na(transaction_idW5)) %&gt;% pull(transaction_idW5) id_to_match &lt;- c(id_to_match, temp_id) } if (!is_empty(temp_id)){ # and last for transaction_id6 temp_id &lt;- waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% filter((transaction_idW5 == temp_id) &amp; !is.na(transaction_idW6)) %&gt;% pull(transaction_idW6) id_to_match &lt;- c(id_to_match, temp_id) } # then we assign a participant number, such that a participant gets the number for each row where any of their transaction_ids are part of the temporary ids waves_2_to_6 &lt;- waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% mutate( id = case_when( transaction_id %in% id_to_match ~ id_counter, transaction_idW2 %in% id_to_match ~ id_counter, transaction_idW3 %in% id_to_match ~ id_counter, transaction_idW4 %in% id_to_match ~ id_counter, transaction_idW5 %in% id_to_match ~ id_counter, transaction_idW6 %in% id_to_match ~ id_counter, TRUE ~ id ) ) # increase the participant number id_counter &lt;- id_counter + 1 } Before we we assign correct variable types, name factor levels etc. we’ll load wave 1. This way, we can merge the two files first before doing all of the data cleaning, variable selection, and variable renaming. 2.2 Read wave 1 Let’s load the file for wave 1. transcaction_id is the unique identifier for each participant. However, that variables is called transaction_idOld in waves 2 to 6, which is why we name it the same here (see above). Also, dWeekMerged is the wave identifier that’s used in waves 2 to 6, so we’ll include that manually here. wave1 &lt;- read_csv( here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;wave1.csv&quot;), guess_max = 2e4 ) %&gt;% rename(transaction_idOld = transaction_id) %&gt;% mutate(dWeekMerged = 1) There are many variables we don’t care about, but before we make the variable selection, I’ll first merge the two files. Here’s another complication: If we look at the surveys and how variables are named there, it looks like there are different labels for the same variables in wave 1 and waves 2 to 6. For example, in wave 1, variables providing the estimated time with a medium had the appendix ai and those asking about self-estimated increases or decreases in frequency had the appendix aii. For waves 2 to 6, the surveys say that this is reversed, such that estimated time with a medium has the appendix aii and self-estimated increase or decrease has the appendix ai. The same goes for variable names: For example, the audiobooks section in wave 1 begins with C7c, but with C6c in waves 2 to 6. In the actual data, however, variable names are constant (see the codebook). For example, audiobooks are C7c in both data sets despite what the survey files say. The variable labels are the same across all waves (I manually checked), which makes merging easier. My merging strategy is as follows: I assign the id we created above to the wave1 data file by merging by transaction_idOld which is available in both data sets. However, that means that those who didn’t participate in wave 2 won’t have an id. So we manually fill those empty cells up - although we’ll probably exclude those who only participant in wave 1 later anyways. I then add the rows of waves_2_to_6 to waves1. I use the bind_rows command, which maintains all variables for which there’s no match and sets them to NA - exactly what we want, because full demographics are only in wave 1 and newer questions only in later waves. Note that from now on I leave the raw wave data untouched and make all changes in a working file. # add the id variable to wave1 by merging by transaction_idOld that&#39;s in both data sets working_file &lt;- left_join( wave1, waves_2_to_6 %&gt;% select(transaction_idOld, id), by = &quot;transaction_idOld&quot; ) # assign an id to those in wave 1 who have an NA in the id column because they didn&#39;t participate in later waves # we can do this easily with coalesce, for which we create a vector that continues from the current max ID until each participant with missing ID has one working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( id = coalesce( id, max(working_file$id, na.rm = T)+1:nrow(working_file) ) ) # then add the rows of waves 2 to 6 to wave 1 working_file &lt;- bind_rows( working_file, waves_2_to_6 ) 2.3 Data cleaning Now that each participant has a constant identifier and all waves are merged, we can select those variables we actually need. For our purposes, we’ll retain: demographic information variables indicating what media people used in the past week time estimates of those uses self-estimated importance of the medium self-estimated frequency the estimated effects on well-being in wave 6 Note that there are quite a lot of filtering variables. We can’t collapse these to one variable because these questions were multiple choice. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% select( # meta information id, wave = dWeekMerged, # demographics occupation_main_earner = PS1a, main_earner = PS1b, income_main_earner = PS1c, income_own = A7, ethnicity = PS2, internet_use = A2, gender = A4, age = A5, employment = A6x1, living_on_my_own = A6x2r1, living_with_children = A6x2r2, living_with_partner = A6x2r3, living_with_partner_children = A6x2r4, living_with_family = A6x2r5, living_with_parents = A6x2r6, living_with_friends = A6x2r7, region = A8, covid_work_home_often = A6x4r1, covid_work_home_always = A6x4r2, covid_work_outside = A6x4r3, covid_work_stopped = A6x4r4, covid_home_schooling = A6x4r5, covid_self_isolating = A6x4r6, covid_none = A6x4r99, # filter questions: downloaded downloaded_music = B1r1, downloaded_music_videos = B1r2, downloaded_video_games = B1r3, downloaded_software = B1r4, downloaded_films = B1r5, downloaded_tv = B1r6, downloaded_sports = B1r7, downloaded_video_clips = B1r8, downloaded_ebooks = B1r9, downloaded_magazines = B1r10, downloaded_audiobooks = B1r11, downloaded_images = B1r12, downloaded_none = B1r13, # filter questions: streamed streamed_music = B2r1, streamed_music_videos = B2r2, streamed_video_games = B2r3, streamed_software = B2r4, streamed_films = B2r5, streamed_tv = B2r6, streamed_sports = B2r7, streamed_video_clips = B2r8, streamed_ebooks = B2r9, streamed_magazines = B2r10, streamed_audiobooks = B2r11, streamed_images = B2r12, streamed_none = B2r13, # filter questions: shared shared_music = B3r1, shared_music_videos = B3r2, shared_video_games = B3r3, shared_software = B3r4, shared_films = B3r5, shared_tv = B3r6, shared_sports = B3r7, shared_video_clips = B3r8, shared_ebooks = B3r9, shared_magazines = B3r10, shared_audiobooks = B3r11, shared_images = B3r12, shared_none = B3r13, # filter questions: bought bought_music = B4r1, bought_video_games = B4r2, bought_software = B4r3, bought_films = B4r4, bought_tv = B4r5, bought_books = B4r6, bought_magazines = B4r7, bought_audiobooks = B4r8, bought_none = B4r9, # music music_identity_ = C1x1r1:C1x1r7, music_hours = C1x1aiHoursc1, music_minutes = C1x1aiMinutesc2, music_estimate = C1x1aii, # films films_identity_ = C2x1r1:C2x1r7, films_hours = C2x1aiHoursc1, films_minutes = C2x1aiMinutesc2, films_estimate = C2x1aii, # tv tv_identity_ = C3x1r1:C3x1r7, tv_hours = C3x1aiHoursc1, tv_minutes = C3x1aiMinutesc2, tv_estimate = C3x1aii, # video games games_identity_ = C5x1r1:C5x1r7, games_hours = C5x1aiHoursc1, games_minutes = C5x1aiMinutesc2, games_estimate = C5x1aii, # e-publishing e_publishing_identity_ = C7x1r1:C7x1r7, # (e-)books books_hours = C7ax1aiHoursc1, books_minutes = C7ax1aiMinutesc2, books_estimate = C7ax1aii, # magazines magazines_hours = C7bx1aiHoursc1, magazines_minutes = C7bx1aiMinutesc2, magazines_estimate = C7bx1aii, # audiobooks audiobooks_hours = C7cx1aiHoursc1, audiobooks_minutes = C7cx1aiMinutesc2, audiobooks_estimate = C7cx1aii, # well-being life_satisfaction_ = QD2r1:QD2r2, well_being_ = QD2r3:QD2r4 ) Alright, now to the tedious part: transforming all variables to the correct type and assigning informative factor level labels.

Those variables (e.g. bought_books) are only present in wave 1, but NA in the other waves. Therefore, we create new variables that show whether a person was asked to indicate their use of a medium, so if they answered yes to any of the filter variables at the beginning of the wave 1 survey. At this point, those filter variables are still numeric, so we’ll add them up. If they’re above 0, participants were asked about that medium. If they’re 0, participants hadn’t used any of the media in the three months before wave 1 and weren’t asked questions about them. Note that I keep those filter variables as numeric for processing later. After we’re done with the filter variables, we can also delete the individual ones. Note that I first check whether any of those filter variables have missing values, but it seems the survey had forced responses here, so we don’t have missings. # check whether any of the filter variables (at wave 1, when they were asked) have missing values working_file %&gt;% filter(wave == 1) %&gt;% summarise( across( c( starts_with(&quot;downloaded&quot;), starts_with(&quot;streamed&quot;), starts_with(&quot;shared&quot;), starts_with(&quot;bought&quot;) ), ~ unique(is.na(.x)) ) ) %&gt;% pivot_longer( everything(), values_to = &quot;missing&quot; ) %&gt;% summarise( &quot;Number of missings: &quot; = sum(missing) ) ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## `Number of missings: ` ## &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 While we’re at it: All constant wave 1 variables now have NA in the subsequent wave. I’ll set those NAs to the wave 1 value because those are stable demographics that apply to each wave. Note that three demographic questions were asked at each wave, employment status, living siutation, and the consequences of COVID-19. # get filter variables (only present at wave 1) filters &lt;- working_file %&gt;% filter(wave == 1) %&gt;% # the filter per category mutate( filter_music = rowSums( select( ., starts_with(&quot;downloaded_music&quot;), starts_with(&quot;streamed_music&quot;), starts_with(&quot;shared_music&quot;), bought_music ) ), filter_films = rowSums( select( ., downloaded_films, streamed_films, shared_films, bought_films ) ), filter_tv = rowSums( select( ., downloaded_tv, streamed_tv, shared_tv, bought_tv ) ), filter_video_games = rowSums( select( ., downloaded_video_games, streamed_video_games, shared_video_games, bought_video_games ) ), filter_ebooks = rowSums( select( ., downloaded_ebooks, streamed_ebooks, shared_ebooks, bought_books ) ), filter_magazines = rowSums( select( ., downloaded_magazines, streamed_magazines, shared_magazines, bought_magazines ) ), filter_audiobooks = rowSums( select( ., downloaded_audiobooks, streamed_audiobooks, shared_audiobooks, bought_audiobooks ) ) ) %&gt;% # recode depending on whether the sum is zero or not mutate( across( starts_with(&quot;filter&quot;), ~ if_else(.x &gt; 0, 1, 0) ) ) %&gt;% # select variables that are constant across all waves select( id, occupation_main_earner:internet_use, contains(&quot;identity&quot;), starts_with(&quot;filter&quot;) ) # add those filters and constant variables so that they become a constant for each pp, deleting old filter variables working_file &lt;- left_join( working_file %&gt;% select( -(occupation_main_earner:internet_use), -contains(&quot;identity&quot;) ), filters, by = &quot;id&quot; ) %&gt;% select( -starts_with(&quot;downloaded&quot;), -starts_with(&quot;streamed&quot;), -starts_with(&quot;shared&quot;), -starts_with(&quot;bought&quot;), ) %&gt;% # some reordering for purely cosmetic purposes select( id:age, region, ethnicity, employment, main_earner, occupation_main_earner, starts_with(&quot;income&quot;), starts_with(&quot;living&quot;), starts_with(&quot;covid&quot;), internet_use, starts_with(&quot;filter&quot;), everything() ) # remove the temp filters file rm(filters) 2.4 Response rates and missing values In this section, I check response rates, response patterns, and missing values. The data set is quite complicated because of the many filter variables. The survey had forced responses, so there aren’t any missings if someone finished the survey. However, because of the many filters, there’ll still be a large amount of missing values that we need to inspect or recode. I think the following information is most relevant to understand response and missingness patterns: How many participants have completed each wave. How many responses we have per medium per wave. 2.4.1 Participants per wave First, let’s see how many people completed each wave, what percentage of people have completed that exact number of wave, how many participants that have exactly this number of waves, and what percentage of participants have completed at least this wave (Table 2.2). Table 2.2: Response rates Waves Participants (only that number of waves) Frequency Participants per wave Frequency per wave 1 1071 27.7 3863 100.0 2 423 11.0 2792 72.3 3 237 6.1 2369 61.3 4 185 4.8 2132 55.2 5 873 22.6 1947 50.4 6 1074 27.8 1074 27.8 2.4.2 Responses per wave and medium Okay, next we inspect how many responses we have per medium per wave. The data set gets complicated here. This is where the filtering requires quite some wrangling: Someone who hasn’t listened to music in the three months before wave 1 will have missing values on all items about music - but only at wave 1. However, at each subsequent wave, participants were asked one of the estimate questions. If they said that they had used a medium less, about the same, or more compared to the previous week, they were then also prompted to provide their use estimates. For example, someone might’ve had a 0 on the filter questions for audio books because they hadn’t listened to audio books the three months before wave 1. For wave 1, then, they didn’t provide the minutes and hours they spent on audio books. In wave 2, they were then asked how their audio book use had changed since the last survey. If they answered anything but the sixth answer option (i.e., they still hadn’t listened to audio books), they were asked to report how many minutes and hours they had used audio books. Here’s why that can be problematic: The participant below (2.3) hadn’t listened to audio books in the first three months and reports that at wave 1, then says at wave 2 that their audio book use hadn’t changed (i.e., selected 3 on the audiobooks_estimate question). But the participant was still asked about their minutes and hours - which is why they filled in bogus numbers. Minutes and hours were forced response as far as I can tell. I wouldn’t take those estimates seriously, because the participant was forced to respond to minutes and hours. We see that in the following waves, they selected the option that they hadn’t listened to audiobooks. Table 2.3: Example of a participant with no change in use id wave filter_audiobooks audiobooks_estimate audiobooks_minutes audiobooks_hours pp_7 1 0 NA NA NA pp_7 2 0 3 1 1 pp_7 3 0 6 NA NA pp_7 4 0 6 NA NA pp_7 5 0 6 NA NA Before we turn to those cases where we can tell a participant didn’t want to provide a use estimate, we need to decide what to do with the filter questions in the first wave. For our research question, we’re interested in how variations in amount of use relate to well-being, not what that relation is among users. Therefore, if someone says that they didn’t use a medium in the three months before the first wave, they are saying that they spent zero time engaging with that medium. The filter questions didn’t ask whether a user has a device they can use to engage with those content categories or whether they had any of the media. So the filter question didn’t ask whether participants were able to engage with a category. It asked whether people used a medium. Therefore, it fits our research question to treat those values as zero. Below, I’ll set all time variables at the first wave to -99 that were skipped in the survey because participants said they didn’t use the medium in the filter questions. I choose -99 to be able to distingiush “natural” zeros (so zeros participants actually filled in) from our imputed zeros. I’ll turn those -99 to zeros later when we inspect data quality. There’s probably a sleek way to write a function that pulls variable names and matches those with the conditional commands in the code, but that’s above my skill level. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( # music across( c(music_hours, music_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_music == 0), -99, .x) ), # films across( c(films_hours, films_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_films == 0), -99, .x) ), # tv across( c(tv_hours, tv_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_tv == 0), -99, .x) ), # video games across( c(games_hours, games_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_video_games == 0), -99, .x) ), # ebooks across( c(books_hours, books_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_ebooks == 0), -99, .x) ), # magazines across( c(magazines_hours, magazines_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_magazines == 0), -99, .x) ), # audiobooks across( c(audiobooks_hours, audiobooks_minutes), ~ if_else((wave == 1 &amp; filter_audiobooks == 0), -99, .x) ) ) Also, when we look at the codebook, we see that hours and minutes were coded such that 0 = 1, 2 = 1, etc. This means someone who has 24 hours actually has 23 hours. Someone who has 60 minutes actually has 59 minutes. Therefore, I subtract one from each hour and minute variable to get the real estimate. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( across( c( contains(&quot;hours&quot;), contains(&quot;minutes&quot;) ), ~ if_else(.x != -99, .x - 1, .x) # we maintain the artificial zero ) ) Now, when participants said they didn’t use a medium for any wave, in the next wave they’re still presented the estimate question. When they answered anything but that they didn’t use the medium, they were asked to provide minutes and hours estimates (see the example participant above). In those hours and minutes survey questions, they were shown what they said in the previous wave. Crucially, they saw their estimate from the previous wave after they had given their estimate. So when I used 0 minutes in the previous week but forget what I said in the previous wave, it’s not unrealistic that I select “a lot less” on the estimate question. In my mind, estimating use in relation to previous time points and giving an absolute estimate of minutes and hours are two separate psychological retrieval processes. Therefore, I don’t have a problem with someone who used 0 minutes of audio books in a wave saying that they used audio books a lot less in the next wave and report to have used them for half an hour. It doesn’t make sense from an objective stand point because 30 minutes is more than 0 minutes, but the estimate question is about participants’ perceived frequency in relation to the past. For that reason, I won’t directly change the 30 minutes to 0, but leave them as is. In other words, I won’t set values to NA by comparing the absolute minutes and hours estimate to the relative frequency estimate. I’ll only make changes in clear cases like the one presented above, where someone clearly didn’t use a medium. I’ll do exclusions in the next section when I look at data quality. For now, let’s deal with those few cases that are as clear-cut as the one presented above. First some house keeping. If participants indicated on one of the estimate questions that they didn’t use that medium in the previous week (only applicable in waves 2 to 6), they’ll receive an NA on their time estimates. So we’ll first set time estimates to -999 if participants say that they didn’t use a medium, following the same logic I outlined above. I use -999 instead of -99 like above to be able to distinguish between imputed zeros in the first wave and imputed zeros in later waves. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( # music across( c(music_hours, music_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; music_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ), # films across( c(films_hours, films_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; films_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ), # tv across( c(tv_hours, tv_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; tv_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ), # video games across( c(games_hours, games_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; games_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ), # ebooks across( c(books_hours, books_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; books_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ), # magazines across( c(magazines_hours, magazines_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; magazines_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ), # audiobooks across( c(audiobooks_hours, audiobooks_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; audiobooks_estimate == 6), -999, .x) ) ) Alright, now let’s check, per medium, who only has 6s and 3s on the estimate questions (aka didn’t use and no change to previous week). Those minutes and hours we’ll set to 0 as well. This applies only to those who didn’t use a medium in the first wave. If you used a medium in the first wave and said that your time remained the same, you shouldn’t get a zero. Setting instances of time with a medium within a participant but across waves to 0 requires some serious data wrangling (or my coding game isn’t strong enough…). To be able to assess who only gave 3 or 6 as an estimate for a medium for waves 2 through 6, we first transform the data to long format. In Table 2.4, I display how the data look like after transformation. Table 2.4: Data in long format id wave medium estimate minutes hours pp_1 1 music 2 10 1 pp_1 1 films 2 0 4 pp_1 1 tv 2 0 6 pp_1 1 games NA -99 -99 pp_1 1 books 2 0 2 pp_1 1 magazines 2 0 2 pp_1 1 audiobooks NA -99 -99 pp_1 2 music 1 12 9 pp_1 2 films 1 12 12 pp_1 2 tv 1 14 16 pp_1 2 games 1 7 6 pp_1 2 books 1 10 13 pp_1 2 magazines 1 8 14 pp_1 2 audiobooks 1 7 5 pp_2 1 music 1 0 4 pp_2 1 films NA -99 -99 pp_2 1 tv NA -99 -99 pp_2 1 games NA -99 -99 pp_2 1 books NA -99 -99 pp_2 1 magazines NA -99 -99 Next, I need to select only those media which participants didn’t say they used at the first wave. Below, I select those, add a marker for that id by medium combination, and then add that marker to the long data frame. # select id by medium combinations that didn&#39;t give an estimate in the fist wave (aka the only NA entries) markers &lt;- media_long %&gt;% filter(is.na(estimate)) %&gt;% select(id, medium) %&gt;% mutate(selected = TRUE) # add those markers to the long data frame media_long &lt;- left_join( media_long, markers, by = c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;) ) Now we know on which rows to operate. We then check whether a medium that wasn’t used in the first wave only got a 3 or a 6 on the estimate in waves 2 to 6 and flag the person by medium combination that indeed doesn’t have a change. Afterwards, we transform those no_change indicators to the wide format. Below shows how these data look like: If it’s NA the person provided an estimate at the first wave. If it’s FALSE the person didn’t provide an estimate at wave 1 (so it was 0 minutes and hours), but their estimate increased or decreased over the next waves. If it’s TRUE the person didn’t provide an estimate at wave 1 and they kept not using or their use didn’t change. no_changes &lt;- media_long %&gt;% filter(selected == TRUE) %&gt;% # everyone who had an NA for an estimate in the first wave filter(wave &gt; 1) %&gt;% # we don&#39;t count the first wave group_by(id, medium) %&gt;% mutate(no_change = if_else(estimate %in% c(3,6), 0, 1)) %&gt;% # if it&#39;s 3 or 6, we assign zero summarise( # so that the sum is zero no_change = sum(no_change) ) %&gt;% mutate(no_change = if_else(no_change == 0, TRUE, FALSE)) %&gt;% # then anything that isn&#39;t zero has at least one 1,2, or 4 in their estimate ungroup() %&gt;% # then turn to wide format pivot_wider( ., names_from = &quot;medium&quot;, values_from = &quot;no_change&quot; ) %&gt;% rename_with( ., .cols = -id, ~ paste0(., &quot;_no_change&quot;) ) Table 2.5 shows how these markers look like. Table 2.5: Markers for whether someone had no change from wave 1 through wave 2 or not, per medium id audiobooks_no_change games_no_change tv_no_change books_no_change magazines_no_change music_no_change films_no_change pp_1 FALSE FALSE NA NA NA NA NA pp_10 TRUE NA FALSE NA NA NA NA pp_100 TRUE NA FALSE FALSE NA NA NA pp_1000 TRUE TRUE NA NA NA NA NA pp_1001 TRUE TRUE NA FALSE TRUE TRUE NA pp_1002 FALSE NA FALSE NA NA NA NA pp_1003 TRUE NA NA NA NA NA NA pp_1004 TRUE NA TRUE TRUE NA NA NA pp_1005 FALSE NA NA NA NA NA NA pp_1006 TRUE FALSE NA NA TRUE NA NA Now we can add those markers to the working_file. working_file &lt;- left_join( working_file, no_changes, by = c(&quot;id&quot;) ) Last, we transform the minutes and hours for each medium in each wave to 0, depending on whether that medium has one of the above markers telling us that the person didn’t use the medium at wave 1 and use didn’t change in subsequent waves (i.e., “not changed” or “haven’t used” on estimate for all subsequent waves). Like above, we use -9999 as an indicator for zero, so we know that -9999 estimates are imputed zeros based on the person not changing their use after having said they don’t use a medium in the first wave. -999 is just someone saying they didn’t use a medium and -99 is not having used a medium in the first wave. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( # music across( c(music_hours, music_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; music_no_change == TRUE), -9999, .x, missing = .x) # need to set missing explicitly because the no_change variables contain NA if someone didn&#39;t have a missing in the first wave ), # films across( c(films_hours, films_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; films_no_change == TRUE &amp; .x != - 999), -9999, .x, missing = .x) # don&#39;t override the -99 ), # tv across( c(tv_hours, tv_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; tv_no_change == TRUE &amp; .x != - 999), -9999, .x, missing = .x) ), # video games across( c(games_hours, games_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; games_no_change == TRUE &amp; .x != - 999), -9999, .x, missing = .x) ), # ebooks across( c(books_hours, books_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; books_no_change == TRUE &amp; .x != - 999), -9999, .x, missing = .x) ), # magazines across( c(magazines_hours, magazines_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; magazines_no_change == TRUE &amp; .x != - 999), -9999, .x, missing = .x) ), # audiobooks across( c(audiobooks_hours, audiobooks_minutes), ~ if_else((wave != 1 &amp; audiobooks_no_change == TRUE &amp; .x != - 999), -9999, .x, missing = .x) ) ) %&gt;% # no need anymore for the variables we added select( -ends_with(&quot;no_change&quot;) ) Let’s do a sanity check: all minutes and hours items should now have entries because they were forced response (or because we set them to zero). That’s indeed the case, so all looking good. working_file %&gt;% summarise( across( c(contains(&quot;minutes&quot;), contains(&quot;hours&quot;)), ~ sum(is.na(.x)) ) ) %&gt;% gather() ## # A tibble: 14 x 2 ## key value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 music_minutes 0 ## 2 films_minutes 0 ## 3 tv_minutes 0 ## 4 games_minutes 0 ## 5 books_minutes 0 ## 6 magazines_minutes 0 ## 7 audiobooks_minutes 0 ## 8 music_hours 0 ## 9 films_hours 0 ## 10 tv_hours 0 ## 11 games_hours 0 ## 12 books_hours 0 ## 13 magazines_hours 0 ## 14 audiobooks_hours 0 In contrast, the estimates will still contain NAs if people didn’t use a medium in the first wave because the survey had them skip those items. After all this wrangling we’re finally able to look at how many responses we have per medium per wave. Actually, the answer is straightforward now: everyone who finished a wave either provided minutes and hours estimates for all media, or they didn’t which means we set them to 0. In other words, the complete responses per wave are also the complete responses per medium. 2.5 Data quality and exclusions In this section, we inspect implausible values, strange response patterns, and potential outliers. 2.5.1 Implausible values Okay, first let’s check that the maximum hour reported is indeed 23 and the maximum minutes 59. Table 2.6 shows that that’s the case. working_file %&gt;% summarise( across( c(contains(&quot;hours&quot;), contains(&quot;minutes&quot;)), ~ max(.x, na.rm = T) ) ) %&gt;% gather() %&gt;% knitr::kable( ., caption = &quot;Maximum values of hours and minutes, per medium&quot; ) Table 2.6: Maximum values of hours and minutes, per medium key value music_hours 23 films_hours 23 tv_hours 23 games_hours 23 books_hours 23 magazines_hours 23 audiobooks_hours 23 music_minutes 59 films_minutes 59 tv_minutes 59 games_minutes 59 books_minutes 59 magazines_minutes 59 audiobooks_minutes 59 Alright, next we did a lot of work on working_file, and media_long isn’t up to date anymore, which is why I turn the working file into the long format once more because it’s easier for some plotting. media_long &lt;- # first turn long by filter variables pivot_longer( working_file %&gt;% select( id, wave, contains(&quot;estimate&quot;), contains(&quot;minutes&quot;), contains(&quot;hours&quot;) ), c(-id, -wave), names_to = c(&quot;medium&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), values_to = &quot;value&quot;, names_sep = &quot;_&quot; ) %&gt;% # now the medium and time are mixed up in the same column, so we spread them pivot_wider( ., id:medium, names_from = &quot;time&quot;, values_from = &quot;value&quot; ) Now let’s see what proportion of minutes and hours we imputed (aka placeholders for zeros). We turned values into -99 if they were in the first wave on a medium a user hadn’t used; to -999 if a user said they hadn’t used a medium in the waves after that; and -9999 if a user hadn’t used a medium in the first wave and reported no changes in all following waves. In Table 2.7, we see we had to impute the most zeros for audiobooks.

In other words: The more participants used a medium, the lower the proportion of imputed zeros for any reason. Also, someone putting down one hour and zero minutes will have a zero up here, so these tables aren’t terribly informative. How much total time is zero is much more informative. Right now, hours and minutes are still separate, so we’ll create a time variable that maintains the negative placeholders we inserted above. media_long &lt;- media_long %&gt;% mutate( # if minutes isn&#39;t negative, create time variable to maintain the placeholders time = round(if_else(minutes &gt;= 0, hours + (minutes / 60), minutes), digits = 1) ) In Table 2.9, we see a clearer pattern: The media with the most use (e.g., TV, music, films) have low imputed zeros, whereas those with little use (especially audio books) have a high amount of imputed zeros. That’s in line with the high proportion of imputed values for no use (i.e., selecting not having used in waves 2 to 6) for the little used media.

The table basically summarizes all tables so far, showing the popularity of the medium and how much we had to impute.

We’ll be working with the working_file again, for which we need to calculate the time per medium. Like before, I’ll do that manually for all seven media. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( # music music_time = music_hours + (music_minutes / 60), # films films_time = films_hours + (films_minutes / 60), # tv tv_time = tv_hours + (tv_minutes / 60), # video games games_time = games_hours + (games_minutes / 60), # ebooks books_time = books_hours + (books_minutes / 60), # magazines magazines_time = magazines_hours + (magazines_minutes / 60), # audiobooks audiobooks_time = audiobooks_hours + (audiobooks_minutes / 60) ) In Figure 2.1 we see the distribution of use time per medium. Those figures aren’t super accurate for practical reasons: For some media, there’s so many zeros that there isn’t enough jitter in the cloud which is why they’re all so bunched up together on the left. There’s many entries of more than 18h of average daily use, which is close to impossible if someone sleeps at least six hours. Figure 2.1: Distribution of self-reported time per medium In Table 2.11 we see that very few entries are above 18h, relative to all other values, which is a good sign. # count proportion per medium media_long %&gt;% group_by(medium) %&gt;% count(time &gt;= 18) %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = `time &gt;= 18`, values_from = &quot;n&quot; ) %&gt;% rename( &quot;Below 18h&quot; = `FALSE`, &quot;Above 18h&quot; = `TRUE` ) %&gt;% mutate( Proportion = round(`Above 18h` / sum(c(`Above 18h`, `Below 18h`)) * 100, digits = 2) ) %&gt;% knitr::kable( ., caption = &quot;Proportion of hours above 18&quot; ) Table 2.11: Proportion of hours above 18 medium Below 18h Above 18h Proportion audiobooks 14165 12 0.08 books 14120 57 0.40 films 13955 222 1.57 games 14025 152 1.07 magazines 14158 19 0.13 music 14000 177 1.25 tv 13775 402 2.84 2.5.1.1 Participant-level Let’s follow up on those who reported 18h or more use of a medium and check whether there are any participants whose estimates we cannot really trust. We need to distinguish between completely excluding a participant (whose answers we don’t trust for all waves they provided) and wave-level exclusions (when we trust the data of the participant, except for one or two waves). As for implausible values on the participant-level, I’d say the following are indicators of poor quality: More than 30% of time estimates participants provided (excluding zeros imputed by us) across all waves are above 18h. More than one instance of a 23h+ estimate across all waves. More than one instance where the sum of nonzero estimates is above 48h in a wave. Let’s look at the proportion of very high reported use times. Self-reported use is also about how much people feel like they used medium, so I’ll be liberal here. I’d say we can’t trust a participant if they estimated 18+ hours in &gt; 30% of all their time estimates, across all waves. Below, I’ll count per participant how many times they estimated 18+ hours of consumption in relation to all time estimates they provided. I’ll not include zero times in that account because we imputed times of zero. implausible_pp_level_1 &lt;- media_long %&gt;% filter(time &gt; 0) %&gt;% # nonzero group_by(id, medium) %&gt;% summarise( above18 = sum(time &gt;= 18), below18 = sum(time &lt; 18), waves = n() ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% summarise( above18 = sum(above18), below18 = sum(below18), entries = sum(waves), proportion_above18 = round(above18 / entries, digits = 2) ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% arrange(desc(proportion_above18)) %&gt;% filter(proportion_above18 &gt; 0.3) # store the participants that were above that threshold exclusions_pp_1 &lt;- implausible_pp_level_1 %&gt;% pull(id) %&gt;% as.character() In Table 2.12 we see that there’s mostly participants that fulfill these exclusions who completed only a wave or two, so there’s most likely a correlation between their motivation to participate and how seriously they took the survey. Note: For all tables on exclusions, I show the first 15 rows.

Next, participants might feel like they played the whole day, so saying 23 hours of play on average is close to impossible. I’d say that can happen, but if it happens twice across waves, I wouldn’t trust that participant. implausible_pp_level_2 &lt;- media_long %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% summarise( above23 = sum(time &gt;= 23), below23 = sum(time &lt; 23) ) %&gt;% filter(above23 &gt; 1) # store the IDs exclusions_pp_2 &lt;- implausible_pp_level_2 %&gt;% pull(id) %&gt;% as.character() There were 37 participants who fell into the second criterion. In Table 2.13 we see that there’s mostly participants that fulfill these exclusions who completed only a wave or two, so there’s most likely a correlation between their motivation to participate and how seriously they took the survey. Table 2.13: Proportion of respondents who reported more than one instance of 23h use across waves id above23 below23 pp_1116 3 32 pp_1162 5 37 pp_1246 2 26 pp_128 7 35 pp_1420 3 39 pp_156 2 19 pp_1737 2 40 pp_2072 2 12 pp_2111 4 38 pp_2287 2 12 pp_2310 2 12 pp_2436 2 40 pp_252 5 30 pp_2533 3 39 pp_2537 3 32 By the same logic, some weeks might feel very intense, and participants surely didn’t keep track of what they reported for use throughout all media. So it’s possible if we add up all times, there’ll be instances where the sum is above 24h, even around 48h. After all, participants can multitask, but if they use three media at the same time for 16 hours, that’s 48h. I’d say that can happen theoretically, but not over multiple weeks. So if there’s more than one wave where the total is equal to or above 48h, I don’t think the participant read the question correctly. # get total time working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( total_time = rowSums(select(., contains(&quot;time&quot;))) ) # get counts of more than 48h total time implausible_pp_level_3 &lt;- working_file %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% summarise( above48_count = sum(total_time &gt;= 48) ) %&gt;% filter(above48_count &gt; 1) # store the IDs exclusions_pp_3 &lt;- implausible_pp_level_3 %&gt;% pull(id) %&gt;% as.character() In Table 2.14 we see that there’s a bunch of participants who had 48h of total media use more than once (in total 53).

Any wave where the sum of use times is above 64h. Any wave where a participant estimated use of 23h or more. Again, it’s probably not uncommon to report a high number if I went on a reading-binge. But I’d say if you sleep eight hours, reporting the rest of the time twice for a wave is suspicious, so there’s probably a typo or someone didn’t take the question seriously. implausible_wave_level_1 &lt;- media_long %&gt;% group_by(id, wave) %&gt;% summarise( two16s = sum(time &gt;= 16) ) %&gt;% filter(two16s &gt; 1) # store the rows that were above that threshold exclusions_wave_1 &lt;- implausible_wave_level_1 %&gt;% select(id, wave) Overall, we have 166 rows of data we need to exclude from 107 participants. However, of those, 72 were already identified as suspicious in the participant-level exclusions. Next, we inspect waves where even excessive multitasking per day exceeds a reasonable threshold. If someone multitasked with three media every waking hour, they’d have 16h x 3 = 48h. Therefore, we exclude waves where the sum of use times is equal or above four times all day multitasking: 16h x 3 = 64. implausible_wave_level_2 &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( total_time = rowSums(select(., contains(&quot;time&quot;))) ) %&gt;% filter(total_time &gt;= 64) %&gt;% select(id, wave, contains(&quot;time&quot;)) # store the rows exclusions_wave_2 &lt;- implausible_wave_level_2 %&gt;% select(id, wave) For this criterion, we have 1026 rows of data we need to exclude from 526 participants. However, of those, 109 were already identified as suspicious in the participant-level exclusions. Last on the wave-level, we want to exclude any row where participants estimated 23h of daily use of any medium. Maybe one can multitask with three media for 16h a day, but an average use of 23h daily for a week is close to impossible. On the participant level, we already had an exclusion criterion where all of people’s rows were excluded if they had more than one estimate of 23h (across all waves). implausible_wave_level_3 &lt;- media_long %&gt;% group_by(id, wave) %&gt;% summarise( max_time = max(time) ) %&gt;% filter(max_time &gt;= 23) # store the rows that were above that threshold exclusions_wave_3 &lt;- implausible_wave_level_3 %&gt;% select(id, wave) For this criterion, we have 184 rows of data we need to exclude from 128 participants. However, of those, 73 were already identified as suspicious in the participant-level exclusions. Before I remove those cases and rows from the data, I’ll go to response patterns. I’ll do the actual exclusions at the end of this section. 2.5.2 Response patterns In surveys, people who didn’t take the study seriously often provide implausible values (see section above), rush, or have response patterns. Out of experience, response patterns are an indicator of poor data quality. I’ll mostly be looking at straightlining, so selecting the same answer option for each item in a scale. Usually, straightlining isn’t uncommon for, say, well-being scales, so I don’t want to be too strict here and exclude valid cases. Also, if participants repeatedly provide the same time estimate across different media, I’d be suspicious of their responses. Anyone who straightlined on more than two of the identity scales (minimum of three media). Anyone who has the same total time in each wave (minimum three media and waves). For the first criterion, we calculate the variance for each identity scale (provided participants provided a response). If someone straightlined at three (of at least three) scales, I wouldn’t trust them to take the survey seriously. Note that magazines and audio books didn’t have identity questions. exclusions_pp_4 &lt;- working_file %&gt;% # create the variance variables per row rowwise() %&gt;% mutate( # music identity variance music_identity_sd = sd( c_across(starts_with(&quot;music_identity&quot;)), na.rm = TRUE ), # films identity variance films_identity_sd = sd( c_across(starts_with(&quot;films_identity&quot;)), na.rm = TRUE ), # tv identity variance tv_identity_sd = sd( c_across(starts_with(&quot;tv_identity&quot;)), na.rm = TRUE ), # games identity variance games_identity_sd = sd( c_across(starts_with(&quot;games_identity&quot;)), na.rm = TRUE ), # epublishing identity variance e_publishing_identity_sd = sd( c_across(starts_with(&quot;e_publishing_identity&quot;)), na.rm = TRUE ) ) %&gt;% unnest(cols = c()) %&gt;% # we&#39;re only looking at the first wave where the identity questions were asked group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(wave == 1) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% # now we check who answered at least three identity scales by summing the filer questions mutate( media_number = rowSums(select(., filter_music:filter_ebooks)), at_least_three = if_else(media_number &gt;= 3, 1, 0) ) %&gt;% filter(at_least_three == 1) %&gt;% # create a variable that counts how many of the variances are zero mutate( multiple_straightlines = rowSums(select(., ends_with(&quot;_sd&quot;)) == 0) ) %&gt;% filter(multiple_straightlines &gt; 2) %&gt;% # and select participants pull(id) %&gt;% as.character() For this criterion, we have 72 participants. Of those, 6 were already identified as suspicious in the participant-level exclusions previously. On to the second criterion: Someone might be very consistent and provide the same use times at each wave (excluding nonzero estimates). However, if a person provides the same use estimates for each medium across all waves (minimum three waves), I’d say they’re just trying to get the survey done and rely on the time that they survey prompted. So below I’ll check who has the same total time (i.e., reporting the same time across all media) in all of their waves. To avoid excluding people for whom this occurred only once, I’ll set a minimum of three media and three waves. # get participants who have at least three waves and media use estimates three_media_and_waves &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( media_number = rowSums(select(., starts_with(&quot;filter&quot;))) # minimum three media ) %&gt;% filter(media_number &gt;= 3) %&gt;% count(id) %&gt;% # count waves filter(n &gt;= 3) %&gt;% pull(id) %&gt;% as.character() # then filter by those participants and check how many times their total times are constant exclusions_pp_5 &lt;- working_file %&gt;% filter(id %in% three_media_and_waves) %&gt;% select(id, wave, total_time) %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% summarise( distinct_times = n_distinct(total_time) ) %&gt;% filter(distinct_times == 1) %&gt;% pull(id) %&gt;% as.character() Only 14 participants fulfilled this criterion. Of those, 1 were already identified as suspicious in the participant-level exclusions previously. Alright, let’s add those participants with response patterns to those with implausible values. exclusions_pp &lt;- c(exclusions_pp, exclusions_pp_4, exclusions_pp_5) %&gt;% unique() 2.5.3 Applying exclusions As a last step, we exclude those participants whom we identified as having low data quality. How many people we exclude will depend on what our starting sample is. Currently, we still have the whole sample, but for the analysis, we’ll restrict valid cases to those who responded to a certain number of waves. Below in Table 2.15 I’ll show, per wave, how many people we’d exclude for each exclusion criterion plus what proportion of the valid sample (aka how many participants have at least that many waves) we have left. Note that some participants fulfill multiple exclusions, so the last columns shows the cumulative exclusions and proportion of the respective sample. For the analysis, mixed-effects models weigh participants with more data more heavily, which means we can use everyone with at least three waves (because we used lagged predictors).

It’s quite possible that having excluded participants with low-quality data already excluded many of their low-quality rows as well. # first, I&#39;ll combine all three wave-level exclusions exclusions_wave &lt;- full_join( exclusions_wave_1, exclusions_wave_2 ) %&gt;% full_join( ., exclusions_wave_3 ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% distinct() I’ll check how many rows that we intended to exclude on the wave-level are already not in the data set anymore because the entire participant that row belongs to was excluded during participant-level exclusions. anti_join( exclusions_wave, working_file, by = c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;wave&quot;) ) %&gt;% nrow() ## [1] 385 Let’s take the data set after participant exclusions, exclude low-quality rows (i.e., waves) and count the number of waves again. Table 2.16 shows the number of participants with at least a number of waves (after participant-level exclusions) next to the same number after excluding on the wave-level. The sharpest drop is in the number of people who previously had completed six waves. That’s not surprising because each unique participant in exclusions_wave (553 participants) who had previously completed six waves now drops down to five waves. Probably there’s a correlation between sticking around for this long and motivation, such that motivation drops in later waves and there’s a higher chance to fulfill one of the exclusion criteria. Overall, 5.13% of rows are excluded. Table 2.16: Participants with at least a number of waves before and after wave-level exclusion Waves Participants per wave Participants per wave after exclusions Reduction proportion % 1 3630 3513 3.22 2 2648 2557 3.44 3 2246 2159 3.87 4 2027 1921 5.23 5 1853 1704 8.04 6 1022 883 13.60 During model fitting, we’ll predict the outcome with the lagged value of the predictor. If we merely exclude the rows participants will have gaps in their waves. For example, a participant might have entries for waves 1-4, but wave 3 belongs to low-quality data rows. We’d then be left with rows 1,2, and 4. During model fitting, just lagging the value would mean the outcome at wave 4 is predicted by the predictor at wave 2 - effectively messing up our one-week lag between waves. Therefore, it makes sense to maintain those rows whose data we exclude, but set them to NA. This way, we don’t have “gaps” between waves. In addition, if we want to impute missing values during model fitting (via the built-in brms imputation), we want to be able to know what value to impute, which is why we need the NA signal. Let’s make those rows that have low quality data, then set all wave-level entries to NA on those rows. # add marker to wave-level exclusions exclusions_wave &lt;- exclusions_wave %&gt;% mutate(set_to_na = 1) # add that marker to working file working_file &lt;- left_join( working_file, exclusions_wave, by = c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;wave&quot;) ) # then set all wave-level entries to NA that have a marker working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( across( c( covid_work_home_often:covid_none, music_hours:well_being_2, music_time:total_time ), ~ replace(.x, set_to_na == 1, NA) ) ) %&gt;% # remove marker select(-set_to_na) 2.6 Build scales As a last step, we’re creating the mean score scales. Before we do that, we have to reverse code some items. Both the estimates and the identity items had strongest agreement as 1. I find it more intuitive when larger numbers mean more agreement. The same applies to the well-being item about anxiety, which I will reverse code. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( across( contains(&quot;identity&quot;), ~ 5 - .x ), across( ends_with(&quot;estimate&quot;), ~ 7 - .x ), well_being_2 = 10 - well_being_2 # starts at 0 ) Let’s start with the identity scales; for each medium (except magazines and audiobooks), participants indicated how much that medium was part of their identity. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( # music music_identity = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;music_identity&quot;))), # films films_identity = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;films_identity&quot;))), # tv tv_identity = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;tv_identity&quot;))), # games games_identity = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;games_identity&quot;))), # epublishing e_publishing_identity = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;e_publishing_identity&quot;))), ) And the well-being scales per wave (aka row). working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( life_satisfaction = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;life_satisfaction&quot;))), affect = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;well_being&quot;))), well_being = rowMeans(select(., starts_with(&quot;well_being&quot;), starts_with(&quot;life_satisfaction&quot;))) # both affect and well-being combined ) Before we move on to visualizations and descriptive info, I’ll do some housekeeping. I’ll reorder some variables for cosmetic purposes, only select those we need, and clean the workspace. # select relevant variables working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% select( id:filter_audiobooks, starts_with(&quot;music&quot;), starts_with(&quot;films&quot;), starts_with(&quot;tv&quot;), starts_with(&quot;games&quot;), starts_with(&quot;e_publishing&quot;), starts_with(&quot;books&quot;), starts_with(&quot;magazines&quot;), starts_with(&quot;audiobooks&quot;), total_time, starts_with(&quot;life_satisfaction&quot;), starts_with(&quot;well_being&quot;), affect, -ends_with(&quot;hours&quot;), # we got the total time from here on -ends_with(&quot;minutes&quot;), ) # clean workspace rm( markers, no_changes, waves_per_id, an_id, id_counter, id_to_match, ids, temp_id, three_media_and_waves ) And then remove those who don’t have at least three waves. For one model part, we’ll used led values, so two waves won’t be enough because that means a participant is left with only one wave once we lead a predictor. Also, some participants now have missing values (because we applied the wave-level exclusions). Missing values will be removed during model fitting, meaning that if someone has three waves, but two of them are NA, they’ll be left with one wave of data. So I’ll filter the data set to only keep those with at least three waves with responses. # get ids of participants who have at least three valid waves at_least_three &lt;- working_file %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(music_time)) %&gt;% filter(n() &gt;= 3) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% pull(id) # then only keep those participants working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% filter(id %in% at_least_three) # remove from workspace rm(at_least_three) "],
["descriptives-and-visualizations.html", "3 Descriptives and visualizations 3.1 Overview 3.2 Person-level 3.3 Wave-level 3.4 Correlation matrices", " 3 Descriptives and visualizations 3.1 Overview In this section, I describe and visualize the variables. We got variables on the person-level and on the wave level. Person-level Age and gender (age, gender) What region of the UK participants are from (region) What their ethnicity is (ethnicity) What their employment status is (employment) Whether they are the main earner (main_earner), what the occupation of the main earner is (occupation_main_earner) plus the main earner’s or their own income (income_main_earner and income_own) Their living situation (variables starting with living) How COVID-19 has affected their situation (variables starting with covid) Whether they’ve used a medium in the three months before the first wave (variables starting with filter) To what extent they identify with a medium (variables ending with identity) Wave-level How much they used a medium per wave (variables ending with time) How much they estimated to have used a medium per wave (variables ending with estimate) Their well-being per wave (well_being) 3.2 Person-level Let’s have a look at the final sample. Overall, our sample size is N = 2159. Participants, on average, were M = 47 years old, SD = 14.6, see Figure 3.1. The gender distribution is pretty equal (1123 women (52.01%), 1035 men, and 1 non-binary participants). Figure 3.1: Distribution of age Alright, next let’s see from what regions participants come from, Table 3.1. The sample is distributed pretty much long the geographical population density. Table 3.1: Region that participants come from Region N Frequency South East 348 16.1 London 239 11.1 North West 232 10.7 East 201 9.3 Scotland 186 8.6 West Midlands 184 8.5 South West 175 8.1 East Midlands 172 8.0 Yorkshire and The Humber 169 7.8 Wales 116 5.4 North East 84 3.9 Northern Ireland 53 2.5 Let’s do the same thing for ethnicity, see Table 3.2. The majority of participants are White British. Table 3.2: Participants’ ethnicity Ethnicity N Frequency White British 1861 86.20 White European 72 3.33 White - Other 60 2.78 Chinese 32 1.48 Indian 28 1.30 Any other Asian/Asian British Origin 18 0.83 Pakistani 17 0.79 African 13 0.60 Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic origins 13 0.60 White and Asian 11 0.51 Caribbean 8 0.37 Bangladeshi 7 0.32 Prefer not to say 6 0.28 Arab 4 0.19 White and Black Caribbean 4 0.19 Any other ethnic origin 2 0.09 Japanese 1 0.05 Any other Black/African/Caribbean British origin 1 0.05 White and Black African 1 0.05 In Table 3.3 we see that the majority of the sample are not employed full time. A substantial proportion are furloughed because of COVID-19. Table 3.3: Participants’ employment Employment N Frequency Employed full time 922 42.70 Retired 335 15.52 Employed part time 302 13.99 Unemployed and not looking for work 217 10.05 Self employed 130 6.02 Employed but furloughed due to the coronavirus pandemic 109 5.05 Student 71 3.29 Unemployed and looking for work 67 3.10 Rather not say 6 0.28 Now let’s check the income brackets. If participants were the main earner, they provided only their income. If participants weren’t the main earner, they provided the income of the main earner and their own. The answers were on an ordinal scale, so adding those two up to a total income doesn’t work. Instead, I’ll simply provide a frequency table of the income of the main earner. Table 3.4 shows the distribution of income brackets. We see that the majority is somewhere around UK median income. Table 3.4: Income of the household main earner Income N Frequency Less than £10,000 170 7.87 £10,000 - £19,999 428 19.82 £20,000 - £29,999 514 23.81 £30,000 - £39,999 393 18.20 £40,000 - £49,999 274 12.69 £50,000 - £59,999 148 6.86 £60,000 - £69,999 84 3.89 £70,000 - £79,999 56 2.59 £80,000 - £89,999 26 1.20 £90,000 - £99,999 22 1.02 £100,000 - £109,999 13 0.60 £110,000 - £119,999 9 0.42 £120,000 - £129,999 3 0.14 £130,000 - £139,999 3 0.14 £140,000 - £149,999 4 0.19 £150,000 - £159,999 2 0.09 £180,000 - £189,999 1 0.05 £230,000 - £239,999 1 0.05 £240,000 - £249,999 1 0.05 £250,000 or more 4 0.19 £190,000 - £199,999 1 0.05 £210,000 - £219,999 2 0.09 Now let’s inspect participants’ occupation. Rather, that’s the occupation of the main earner. In Table 3.5 we see that the majority have a white collar job. Table 3.5: Occupation of the household main earner Occupation of the main earner N Frequency Supervisory or clerical/junior managerial/ professional/ administrative 636 29.46 Intermediate managerial/professional/administrative 584 27.05 Skilled manual worker 361 16.72 Semi-skilled or unskilled work 277 12.83 Unemployed 152 7.04 Higher managerial/professional/administrative 133 6.16 In full time education 16 0.74 Alright, how do participants live? This item was a multiple choice question, so we’ll have more responses than participants. I’ll not plot the unique combinations, but rather summarize across variables. Participants answered this question at each wave, so we’ll plot the proportions over time. At this point, it’s easiest to first turn the data into the long format, then count, then back to wide format. Table 3.2 shows that the majority are living with a partner and/or with partner and children, but also that over time those with living with a partner become fewer. Figure 3.2: Living situation over time (multiple choice possible) Let’s do the same for the impact of COVID-19. Note that this item was a) multiple choice again, b) not all options were shown to all participants, c) asked at each wave. I’ll show the proportions as a line graph, faceting by the grouping of work and parenting situation. Figure 3.3 shows that the majority of participants had to work from home full time or had to stop working altogether. Figure 3.3: Proportion of consequences of COVID-19 by demographic group Alright, next let’s have a look again (now that we have the final sample) at how many people had used a medium in the three months before wave 1 (Table 3.6). Table 3.6: Frequency of how much a medium was used at wave 1 Medium Used Not Used Proportion audiobooks 274 1885 12.7 ebooks 1032 1127 47.8 films 1339 820 62.0 magazines 498 1661 23.1 music 1420 739 65.8 tv 1310 849 60.7 video_games 624 1535 28.9 Now let’s have a look at how much people identified with each medium. Note that people weren’t asked those identity questions if they indicated that they hadn’t used a medium at wave 1. Table 3.7: Descriptive information for identity scales variable N mean sd median min max range cilow cihigh music_identity 1420 2.19 0.67 2.14 1 4 3 2.16 2.23 tv_identity 1310 2.16 0.63 2.14 1 4 3 2.13 2.20 films_identity 1339 2.26 0.67 2.14 1 4 3 2.22 2.29 games_identity 624 2.48 0.82 2.43 1 4 3 2.42 2.55 e_publishing_identity 1211 2.33 0.69 2.29 1 4 3 2.29 2.37 Figure 3.4 shows the distributions of those identity variables. Apparently gamers identified more with games than for example music listeners identified with music. Figure 3.4: Distribution of identity variables 3.3 Wave-level Let’s inspect the descriptive information for the different media. Table 3.8 shows that people used TV, music, and films the most, but spent little time on magazines and audio books. Table 3.8: Descriptive information for use time (including zero estimates) variable N mean sd median min max range cilow cihigh music_time 10985 2.28 2.57 2.00 0 22.22 22.22 2.24 2.33 tv_time 10985 3.25 3.38 2.50 0 22.00 22.00 3.18 3.31 films_time 10985 2.33 2.62 2.00 0 22.25 22.25 2.28 2.37 games_time 10985 0.98 2.24 0.00 0 22.00 22.00 0.94 1.02 books_time 10985 1.09 1.96 0.17 0 21.00 21.00 1.05 1.12 magazines_time 10985 0.24 0.87 0.00 0 20.00 20.00 0.23 0.26 audiobooks_time 10985 0.16 0.78 0.00 0 20.00 20.00 0.15 0.18 Figure 3.5 shows the distributions of those time variables. Note that most distributions are zero-inflated with a heavy skew. Figure 3.5: Distribution of time variables (with zeros) Let’s also inspect those summary statistics and distributions without zeros. Table 3.9 shows the same pattern was with zeros, but overall higher means. Interestingly, those who listen to audiobooks report to do so for a long time per day. Table 3.9: Descriptive information for use time (excluding zero estimates) variable N mean sd median min max range cilow cihigh music_time 8251 3.04 2.54 2.25 0.02 22.22 22.20 2.99 3.09 tv_time 8537 4.18 3.29 3.00 0.02 22.00 21.98 4.11 4.25 films_time 7956 3.21 2.58 2.33 0.02 22.25 22.23 3.15 3.27 games_time 3873 2.78 3.04 2.00 0.02 22.00 21.98 2.69 2.88 books_time 5561 2.14 2.31 1.50 0.02 21.00 20.98 2.08 2.21 magazines_time 2442 1.09 1.58 0.67 0.02 20.00 19.98 1.03 1.16 audiobooks_time 1101 1.64 1.93 1.00 0.02 20.00 19.98 1.52 1.75 Figure 3.6 shows a less skewed distribution once we remove zeros. Figure 3.6: Distribution of time variables (without zeros) As a next step, let’s see how use developed over time. Figure 3.7 shows that most media stay stable, except maybe an overall spike in wave 2. Figure 3.7: Average use over time per medium Let’s also check how estimates look like over time per medium. We’ll only use answers when there was use. Recall that I reverse coded the estimates question, so now 1 means not having used a medium. I’ll remove all answers where people haven’t used a medium and then recode so that 1 means having used a lot less. Table 3.10 shows that, on average across all waves, participants felt like their used remained stable. Table 3.10: Descriptive information for estimates variable N mean sd median min max range cilow cihigh music_estimate 9338 3.34 0.85 3 1 5 4 3.32 3.35 tv_estimate 9829 3.22 0.78 3 1 5 4 3.20 3.23 films_estimate 9298 3.28 0.82 3 1 5 4 3.27 3.30 games_estimate 5578 3.12 0.78 3 1 5 4 3.10 3.14 books_estimate 6834 3.21 0.76 3 1 5 4 3.19 3.23 magazines_estimate 4045 3.01 0.64 3 1 5 4 2.99 3.03 audiobooks_estimate 2270 3.07 0.69 3 1 5 4 3.05 3.10 Figure 3.8 shows the typical distribution of ordinal variables. Even then, the mean and median are clearly around the midpoint of the scale. Figure 3.8: Distribution of estimate variables Let’s inspect how those estimates behave over time. Figure 3.9 shows that there’s a clear downward trend in the estimates the longer the study lasted, with the sharpest drop at wave 2 - ironically, where the self-reported use went up. Figure 3.9: Average estimates over time per medium Last, let’s see the overall descriptives of the well-being variables. Table 3.11 shows that both life satisfaction and affect were above the mid-point of the scale - even though for affect, it’s a close call. Table 3.11: Well-being descriptives variable N mean sd median min max range cilow cihigh affect 10985 5.938689 2.181849 6 0 10 10 5.897883 5.979495 life_satisfaction 2103 6.410366 2.032778 7 0 10 10 6.323436 6.497296 Let’s plot the distribution of both affect and life satisfaction in Figure 3.10. Figure 3.10: Distribution of well-being across waves and participants Last, let’s look at how well-being develops over time. Figure 3.11 shows that life satisfaction appears stable: note the y-axis is on decimal points (original range: 0 to 10). In contrast, affect has significantly decreased, mostly because anxiety has decreased (not shown on graph). Figure 3.11: Average estimates over time per medium 3.4 Correlation matrices Let’s have a look at the row correlations between the media use variables and well-being. Figure 3.12 shows that a) most media use is correlated, and b) there are negative, but very small correlations between well-being and media use. The significance is negligible here just because the sample is so large. That said, we haven’t done any grouping yet, so the correlation matrix treats all observations as independent, which is clearly not the case. Figure 3.12: Correlation matrix of hours spent with a medium and well-being Figure 3.13 shows the correlations between estimates of change of use and well-being. The pattern is similar to that of use and well-being with even smaller effect sizes. Figure 3.13: Correlation matrix of estimated time spent with a medium and well-being "],
["analysis.html", "4 Analysis 4.1 Data preparation 4.2 Music", " 4 Analysis Our overarching research question is how media use in different categories and well-being influence each other over time. There were four well-being items; two were asking about life in general, two about affective states yesterday. I don’t think, just based on face validity, that these four items form one concept, which is why I treated them separately in the data processing. Let’s run a confirmatory factor analysis on the first wave and inspect the fit. The fit is poor-ish and the model suggest that we should correlate the residuals of the life satisfaction items with each other and of the affect items with each other. That confirms my idea about treating those four items as coming from two different constructs. load(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;workspace.RData&quot;)) cfa_model &lt;- &quot;well_being_factor =~ life_satisfaction_1 + life_satisfaction_2 + well_being_1 + well_being_2&quot; # get fit cfa_fit &lt;- cfa( cfa_model, data = working_file %&gt;% filter(wave == 1) ) # inspect summary summary( cfa_fit, fit.measures = TRUE, modindices = TRUE ) ## lavaan 0.6-7 ended normally after 25 iterations ## ## Estimator ML ## Optimization method NLMINB ## Number of free parameters 8 ## ## Used Total ## Number of observations 2103 2159 ## ## Model Test User Model: ## ## Test statistic 152.823 ## Degrees of freedom 2 ## P-value (Chi-square) 0.000 ## ## Model Test Baseline Model: ## ## Test statistic 4689.433 ## Degrees of freedom 6 ## P-value 0.000 ## ## User Model versus Baseline Model: ## ## Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 0.968 ## Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) 0.903 ## ## Loglikelihood and Information Criteria: ## ## Loglikelihood user model (H0) -16789.925 ## Loglikelihood unrestricted model (H1) -16713.513 ## ## Akaike (AIC) 33595.849 ## Bayesian (BIC) 33641.058 ## Sample-size adjusted Bayesian (BIC) 33615.641 ## ## Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: ## ## RMSEA 0.189 ## 90 Percent confidence interval - lower 0.165 ## 90 Percent confidence interval - upper 0.215 ## P-value RMSEA &lt;= 0.05 0.000 ## ## Standardized Root Mean Square Residual: ## ## SRMR 0.038 ## ## Parameter Estimates: ## ## Standard errors Standard ## Information Expected ## Information saturated (h1) model Structured ## ## Latent Variables: ## Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) ## well_being_factor =~ ## life_stsfctn_1 1.000 ## life_stsfctn_2 0.952 0.019 51.334 0.000 ## well_being_1 1.012 0.018 54.730 0.000 ## well_being_2 0.575 0.032 18.148 0.000 ## ## Variances: ## Estimate Std.Err z-value P(&gt;|z|) ## .life_stsfctn_1 0.764 0.047 16.108 0.000 ## .life_stsfctn_2 1.413 0.058 24.476 0.000 ## .well_being_1 1.156 0.055 20.862 0.000 ## .well_being_2 6.871 0.216 31.883 0.000 ## well_beng_fctr 3.740 0.143 26.163 0.000 ## ## Modification Indices: ## ## lhs op rhs mi epc sepc.lv sepc.all sepc.nox ## 10 life_satisfaction_1 ~~ life_satisfaction_2 147.866 1.518 1.518 1.461 1.461 ## 11 life_satisfaction_1 ~~ well_being_1 49.432 -1.025 -1.025 -1.090 -1.090 ## 12 life_satisfaction_1 ~~ well_being_2 29.103 -0.381 -0.381 -0.166 -0.166 ## 13 life_satisfaction_2 ~~ well_being_1 29.103 -0.639 -0.639 -0.500 -0.500 ## 14 life_satisfaction_2 ~~ well_being_2 49.432 -0.554 -0.554 -0.178 -0.178 ## 15 well_being_1 ~~ well_being_2 147.867 0.928 0.928 0.329 0.329 4.1 Data preparation We’re interested in reciprocal effects of media use and well-being. Usually, I’d go for Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models (RICLPM), but we have such massive zero inflation that the distribution of media use might bias the results. I emailed one of the co-authors of the Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models and he said that these models are only well-understood for normally distributed data. Absent any simulation studies that show that these models can retrieve parameters from a non-normal data generating process, I’ll look for an alternative. Instead, I’ll rely on a mixed-models framework. Per well-being outcome (so affect and life satisfaction) and medium, I’ll run two models: The first model predicts well-being from lagged media use. We can treat well-being as normally distributed. The second mode predicts media use from lagged well-being. We treat media use as zero-inflated with a gamma distribution. These models have the advantage that we don’t need to impute missing waves. Instead, the model will weigh those with more data more heavily for the outcome distribution. Because we use lagged predictors in the model predicting use, a participant must have at least three valid waves. When we lag, the model will automatically exclude the first wave (because half of its information is contained in the second wave now). Some participants also have missing values on some waves - which is why we only kept those participants with at least three rows of data. So someone with all six waves but four excluded waves will not be included in the final sample. For both types of models, we’ll separate between- and within-person effects. We’ll not control for the lagged value of the dependent variable, see here. To be able to distinguish between within- and between-person effects, we’ll need to make use of centering. We’re dividing each predictor into a stable, level-2 (person-level) component, and a component that tells us how much each measurement deviates from that stable component (level-1 or within-person effect). See instructions from this excellent blog post. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate( across( c( affect, life_satisfaction, ends_with(&quot;time&quot;) ), list( between = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), within = ~ .x - mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE) ) ) ) %&gt;% ungroup() Also, we’re interested in the threshold of going from not using a medium to using a medium. This is due to how the media use variable is distributed: Lots of zeros and continuous if not zero. Because of how we treated zeros so far, we know that zeros are qualitatively different from nonzeros. Zero means not having used at all (possibly a different process), nonzero means how much you used a medium if you used it. When media use is the outcome variable, we’ll model those different processes with a zero-inflation distribution. It’s my understanding that it’s not a good idea to select an outcome distribution based on the histogram of a variable. Richard McElreath calls this “histomancy”. After all, it’s about the distribution of the residuals after model fitting - so a weird looking distribution might still be the result of a normally distributed data generating process. In our case, I think the use variable doesn’t come from a normally distributed data generating process because we know that using vs. not using a medium is a different process. Likewise, we know that if someone used a medium, their use time cannot be zero and will be skewed toward lower values, with fewer and fewer larger values as use increases. That’s a typical case for a Gamma distribution. When media use is the predictor, we need to tell the model that there’s something special about zeros or not zeros. That’s why we’ll include a new indicator variable for whether use is zero or not. See this discussion. In this discussion, they talk about a case where there’s only one observation per case. However, I want to distinguish within- and between-person effects, like I did with the continuous part of use time. I’ll match that strategy with the indicator. First, per medium and wave, I’ll create an index variable that’s 1 when someone used a medium for a wave, and 0 when not. Second, I’ll take the average of that index variable per person. That gives us a between-person proportion. The parameter for that proportion will tell us what happens for well-being if we compare nonusers (0 proportion) to users (100 proportion), so if we go from 0 to 1. Third, we center each participant’s rows with that proportion, just like we did with use time. The parameter for this variable tells us what happens within a person when they go from not using to using, so if we go from their average to their average plus one. For example, suppose someone listened to music in three of the six waves. They’ll have their average time as the between-person effect and their deviation from that average time as the within-person effect. That’s what we did with the centering above. That person will therefore have a constant proportion of having listened to music (yes or no) of 50%. The parameter for this variable will then tell us what happens if we go one up on the proportion scale, which is bound at [0|1]. In other words, if there’s someone else who listened to music in 67% of waves, the model will give us a parameter for a comparison of not using (0) to using (1), based on all the proportion between people. Strictly speaking, the model will tell us what happens if the proportion increases by one, but we can interpret this increase as going from nonuse to use because the proportion is bound at those values. As for the within-part, say the first person listened to music every other wave. Their within-indicator would then take the values of used (1 or 0) minus proportion of use (0.5) = c(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5) for the six waves. The parameter for that indicator would tell us what happens if a user goes up one point above their average proportion of listening to music across all waves. But this proportion is bound at [0|1], so effectively this tells us what happens if the user goes from not listening to music to listening to music (aka 1 up) because the raw scores are always 0 or 1. I’ll create this index variable and center it like I did above. Note that we already have filter variables, but those refer to whether someone used a medium in the three months before the first wave. That’s why I’ll use the used suffix here. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( across( c( ends_with(&quot;time&quot;), -total_time ), list( used = ~ if_else(.x == 0, 0, 1) ) ) ) %&gt;% # remove the _time part of the variable name rename_with( ~ str_remove(.x, &quot;time_&quot;), ends_with(&quot;used&quot;) ) %&gt;% # center those variables group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate( across( ends_with(&quot;used&quot;), list( between = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), within = ~ .x - mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE) ) ) ) We had NAs for those who had poor quality data in a row. However, when introducing the between variables above, we assigned a constant per participant, overwriting the NA. So I’ll reintroduce NA on the between and used variables. I’ll condition on a random variable that’s NA - affect in this case.. Any other variable would also work because all wave-level entries will be NA. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% mutate( across( c( contains(&quot;used&quot;), contains(&quot;between&quot;) ), ~ replace(.x, is.na(affect), NA) ) ) Last, we need to create the lagged and led variables. If we add them to the model as lag(variable)/lead(variable), it will merely shift values one up/down across all participants. But we need to lag/lead for each participant. We can do that when specifying the data, but that’s prone to error with that many models. So I’ll manually create lagged/led variables in our working file where we lag/lead per participant. Note that we don’t need to lag everything here: The data are “naturally” lagged. At each wave, participants reported their average daily use of a medium for the preceding week and their current well-being. So lagging the times variable would mean we’re predicting current well-being with the reports of use from last week, which themselves refer to the week before. Therefore, we don’t need to lag the time variables - they are lagged already. The same holds for variables that show whether someone used a medium or not. They’re also referring to the previous week, so are “naturally” lagged. As for the well-being indicators: Here we don’t want to lag the variable, but lead them. Affect at wave 1 should predict use and time at wave 2, so we need to “move down” use and time one row per participant. Obviously, lagging well-being or leading use is the same, but I find leading more intuitive here because it corresponds to the time line of the data. working_file &lt;- working_file %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate( across( c( ends_with(&quot;_time&quot;) ), lead, .names = &quot;lead_{.col}&quot; ) ) %&gt;% ungroup() 4.2 Music 4.2.1 Affect 4.2.1.1 Music on affect Let’s begin with modeling affect and music over time. In addition to separating within and between effects, we also let the within effects vary. So the fixed effects tell us how much an average person changed on well-being a week later if they went from not using to using a medium and how much well-being changed if a person used a medium an hour more than they usually do. We allow both of those effects to vary across participants. Note, I only ran those once because the analysis takes time (~ half an hour on my machine) and the files get huge (this one is almost 1 GB). music_affect &lt;- brm( data = working_file, family = gaussian, affect ~ 1 + music_used_between + music_used_within + music_time_between + music_time_within + (1 + music_time_within + music_used_within | id), iter = 5000, warmup = 2000, chains = 4, cores = 4, seed = 42, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95), file = here(&quot;models&quot;, &quot;music_affect&quot;) ) Let’s inspect the traceplots. Overall, they look fine and the chains seem to have mixed well, see (Figure ??). Figure 4.1: Traceplots and posterior distributions for Music-Affect model Figure 4.2: Traceplots and posterior distributions for Music-Affect model Figure 4.3: Traceplots and posterior distributions for Music-Affect model The posterior predictive distribution (Figure 4.4) shows that the model does an okay job in predicting our outcome. It retrieves mean well, but the outcome is not fully normally distributed, which we see in the posterior predictive distribution and hence the median is overestimated by the model. I’d say fitting another distribution (e.g., a skewed normal) might be overfitting - I think a normal data generating process for well-being is adequate. Figure 4.4: Posterior predictive checks for Music-Affect model Let’s also check for potentially influential values. Quite a lot are flagged: This might have to do with the fact that some participants only had three observations. If we leave one out, the posterior will be influenced heavily by the two remaining observation, see the discussion here. Unfortunately, using moment matching to get better LOO estimates doesn’t work for me, even when I save all parameters. Apparently, this could be a bug. And calculating ELPD directly isn’t an option because it would take days. Overall, I’m inclined to trust the model (conditional on us using a normal outcome distribution) because of the model diagnostics. It’s possible that some of the larger values on the time variable (which are quite rare) have a large influence on the posterior if they come from the same person. But we already excluded many implausible values, so this is the sample we’re working with and from which we want to generalize to the population. music_affect_loo &lt;- loo(music_affect) music_affect_loo ## ## Computed from 12000 by 10985 log-likelihood matrix ## ## Estimate SE ## elpd_loo -18112.0 105.4 ## p_loo 1955.7 34.5 ## looic 36224.0 210.8 ## ------ ## Monte Carlo SE of elpd_loo is NA. ## ## Pareto k diagnostic values: ## Count Pct.

Let’s inspect the summary. We see that: Music listeners were less happy than those who didn’t listen to music (music_used_between). The model also estimates the effect to be quite large: listeners scored 0.38 points lower on the ten-point scale. The credible interval doesn’t include zero, so conditional on the model, the data are 95% likely to have been generated by a true effect that does not include zero. However, if a person went from not listening to listening, they felt better the next week (music_used_within). That effect is smaller than the between effect: If someone stopped listening they felt 0.12 points worse. The credible interval doesn’t contain zero, but barely. When a person listened to one hour more music than someone else, that person also felt slightly worse (music_time_between). However, the effect is small and the posterior contains zero as well as positive effects, so we can’t be certain. The same goes for a one-hour increase from one’s typical music listening (music_time_within): the effect is positive, but super small and the posterior contains zero as well as negative values. summary(music_affect) ## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: affect ~ 1 + music_used_between + music_used_within + music_time_between + music_time_within + (1 + music_time_within + music_used_within | id) ## Data: working_file (Number of observations: 10985) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 5000; warmup = 2000; thin = 1; ## total post-warmup samples = 12000 ## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 2159) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## sd(Intercept) 1.86 0.03 1.80 1.92 1.00 2558 5066 ## sd(music_time_within) 0.06 0.03 0.01 0.11 1.00 1546 1804 ## sd(music_used_within) 0.22 0.11 0.03 0.45 1.00 3101 3835 ## cor(Intercept,music_time_within) -0.22 0.21 -0.68 0.15 1.00 6556 3633 ## cor(Intercept,music_used_within) 0.46 0.26 -0.07 0.92 1.00 7058 6344 ## cor(music_time_within,music_used_within) -0.05 0.46 -0.87 0.79 1.00 4688 6431 ## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## Intercept 6.26 0.09 6.07 6.44 1.00 2009 3590 ## music_used_between -0.38 0.13 -0.63 -0.12 1.00 1849 3799 ## music_used_within 0.12 0.06 0.01 0.24 1.00 24236 9993 ## music_time_between -0.02 0.02 -0.06 0.02 1.00 1988 3865 ## music_time_within 0.01 0.01 -0.01 0.03 1.00 19482 10123 ## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## sigma 1.13 0.01 1.11 1.15 1.00 9868 9496 ## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).

Let’s visualize that summary and look at the effects. Figure ?? shows that the used effects have less uncertainty associated with the extreme ends of the distribution, whereas time effects have a lot of uncertainty around smaller and larger values, probably because there aren’t many data points here. Figure 4.5: Conditional effects for Music-Affect model Figure 4.6: Conditional effects for Music-Affect model Figure 4.7: Conditional effects for Music-Affect model Figure 4.8: Conditional effects for Music-Affect model 4.2.1.2 Affect on music Let’s do the other lag of the model: The effect of affect in the previous week on music listening. Here, we’ll use a zero-inflated gamma distribution. The zero-inflation is obvious: Not everyone uses each medium at each wave. Like I said above, that’s a clear argument that zero vs. not zero is a different data generating process than time listened. And like above, where I wanted to see how listening vs. not listening is related to affect a week later, I want to see whether changes in affect are related to changes in the probability to listen to music a week later. Besides predicting listening vs. not listening, we also want to see whether changes in affect are related to changes in music listening duration a week later (so the non-zero parts of media use). We know that the non-zero duration is continuous (i.e., hours) and cannot be zero. We can also see from the distribution that the variation increases with larger values, so the variation likely increases with the mean. That’s why I think a Gamma distribution is adequate. Below I run the model. Note again that music time is naturally lagged (i.e., reported for the previous week). So get the lagged effect of affect on music time, we use the led music time. On my machine, the model took about an two hours. affect_music &lt;- brm( bf( # predicting continuous part lead_music_time ~ 1 + affect_between + affect_within + (1 + affect_within | id), # predicting hurdle part hu ~ 1 + affect_between + affect_within + (1 + affect_within | id) ), data = working_file, family = hurdle_gamma(), , iter = 5000, warmup = 2000, chains = 4, cores = 4, seed = 42, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95), file = here(&quot;models&quot;, &quot;affect_music&quot;) ) Let’s inspect the traceplots. Overall, they look fine and the chains seem to have mixed well, see (Figure ??). Figure 4.9: Traceplots and posterior distributions for Affect-Music model Figure 4.10: Traceplots and posterior distributions for Affect-Music model Figure 4.11: Traceplots and posterior distributions for Affect-Music model The posterior predictive distribution (Figure 4.12) shows that the model does an excellent job in predicting our outcome - at least if we follow the distribution. Self-reported time will necessarily bundle around full and half hours (e.g., 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h etc.), which is why the distribution of the data has spikes. The model smooths those spikes, which is a good thing because we want to get at the data generating process. It retrieves the mean well, but underestimates the median, quite possibly because the model expects less zeros, but more very small values - which is what we want from multilevel models: shrinkage. The other model fit diagnostics are okay, but not great. Figure 4.12: Posterior predictive checks for Affect-Music model Let’s also check for potentially influential values. A lot are flagged, like in the previous model: Again, I think that speaks for the flexibility of the model. There are multiple participants with only two observations. If we leave one out, the posterior will be influenced heavily by the one remaining observation Once more, I’m inclined to trust the model because the model diagnostics looked good. affect_music_loo &lt;- loo(affect_music) affect_music_loo ## ## Computed from 12000 by 8698 log-likelihood matrix ## ## Estimate SE ## elpd_loo -11519.8 123.4 ## p_loo 2101.0 53.1 ## looic 23039.6 246.8 ## ------ ## Monte Carlo SE of elpd_loo is NA. ## ## Pareto k diagnostic values: ## Count Pct.

Summary: For mu we’re on the log scale, so we need to exponentiate which yields exp(0.97) = 2.64 hours on non-zero music time - when a participant has zero affect and no deviation from that affect, so not a very meaningful number (Intercept) For the hurdle, so the odds of having zero rather than not zero, the model estimates considerable shrinkage: The probability of having a zero is plogis(-9.46) = 7.790052210^{-5}, much smaller than the proportion of zeros in the actual data. That’s okay, because most zeros come from very few participants who have all zero, so the model takes that into account (hu_Intercept). When we look at the effect of affect on non-zero hours, we’re still on the log scale, meaning we need to exponentiate which gives us the factor at which y increases with each increase on x: If we compare a participant with another participant with an increase of one on affect, their music time increases (so decreases) by a factor of exp(-0.02) = 0.98 one week later - a small effect, but the posterior doesn’t include zero (affect_between) The same goes for the within effect: As a person goes up one point on affect compared to their typical affect score, their music time increases (i.e., decreases) by a factor of exp(-0.004) = 1 - a completely negligible, small effect whose posterior includes zero (affect_within). As for whether affect influences whether someone went from not listening to music to listening to music: The between effect shows that people with higher affect also have higher odds of not listening to music across all waves: exp(0.48) = 1.6160744 for hu_affect_between. Interestingly, if the average users went went up one point from their typical affect, they had higher odds of not listening to music a week later, exp(0.21) = 1.2336781. summary(affect_music) ## Family: hurdle_gamma ## Links: mu = log; shape = identity; hu = logit ## Formula: lead_music_time ~ 1 + affect_between + affect_within + (1 + affect_within | id) ## hu ~ 1 + affect_between + affect_within + (1 + affect_within | id) ## Data: working_file (Number of observations: 8698) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 5000; warmup = 2000; thin = 1; ## total post-warmup samples = 12000 ## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 2157) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## sd(Intercept) 0.76 0.01 0.73 0.79 1.00 2207 4724 ## sd(affect_within) 0.04 0.02 0.00 0.07 1.00 845 1934 ## sd(hu_Intercept) 8.86 0.53 7.88 9.96 1.00 3052 5772 ## sd(hu_affect_within) 0.31 0.23 0.01 0.86 1.00 2528 5195 ## cor(Intercept,affect_within) -0.35 0.24 -0.88 0.05 1.00 3478 2685 ## cor(hu_Intercept,hu_affect_within) -0.39 0.56 -0.99 0.87 1.00 5938 7531 ## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## Intercept 0.97 0.06 0.86 1.09 1.00 1812 3180 ## hu_Intercept -9.46 0.94 -11.39 -7.70 1.00 1799 3685 ## affect_between -0.02 0.01 -0.04 -0.00 1.00 1901 3045 ## affect_within -0.00 0.01 -0.02 0.01 1.00 17660 10180 ## hu_affect_between 0.48 0.13 0.23 0.74 1.00 1597 3508 ## hu_affect_within 0.21 0.20 -0.08 0.68 1.00 4093 6519 ## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## shape 5.35 0.11 5.14 5.58 1.00 5354 8356 ## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).

I’ll apply the same steps as I did above with affect and music, but won’t describe every parameter unless there’s something unusual that sticks out.

Let’s inspect the summary. We see that: Music listeners had lower satisfaction with life than non-listeners (music_used_between), but the effect is much smaller than for affect and the posterior contains both zero and a lot of negative values However, if a person went from not listening to listening, they reported higher life satisfaction nthe next week (music_used_within), but posterior contains zero. When a person listened to one hour more music than someone else, that person reported slightly higher life satisfaction (music_time_between), but 0 is in CI.

Summary: Those with higher life satisfaction have a (very small) tendency to listen to more music a week later than those with lower life satisfaction: exp(0.02) = 1.02 (life_satisfaction_between) As a person goes up one point on affect compared to their typical life satisfaction score, their music time increases by a factor of exp(0.002) = 1 - a completely negligible, small effect whose posterior includes zero (life_satisfaction_within). The between effect shows that people with higher life satisfaction also have lower odds of not listening to music across all waves: exp(-0.31) = 0.733447 for hu_life_satisfaction_between - but the posterior goes from negative to positive. If the average users went went up one point from their typical life satisfaction score, they had lower odds of not listening to music a week later, exp(-0.15) = 0.860708, but again the posterior includes a wide range of values, including zero. summary(life_music) ## Family: hurdle_gamma ## Links: mu = log; shape = identity; hu = logit ## Formula: lead_music_time ~ 1 + life_satisfaction_between + life_satisfaction_within + (1 + life_satisfaction_within | id) ## hu ~ 1 + life_satisfaction_between + life_satisfaction_within + (1 + life_satisfaction_within | id) ## Data: working_file (Number of observations: 8698) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 5000; warmup = 2000; thin = 1; ## total post-warmup samples = 12000 ## ## Group-Level Effects: ## ~id (Number of levels: 2157) ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## sd(Intercept) 0.76 0.01 0.73 0.79 1.00 2364 4922 ## sd(life_satisfaction_within) 0.04 0.02 0.00 0.08 1.00 1295 3789 ## sd(hu_Intercept) 9.01 0.55 8.00 10.19 1.00 3125 5342 ## sd(hu_life_satisfaction_within) 0.50 0.24 0.06 1.02 1.00 2794 3283 ## cor(Intercept,life_satisfaction_within) -0.03 0.34 -0.78 0.75 1.00 9234 4000 ## cor(hu_Intercept,hu_life_satisfaction_within) 0.11 0.55 -0.88 0.94 1.00 5983 6577 ## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## Intercept 0.71 0.07 0.58 0.84 1.00 1752 3009 ## hu_Intercept -6.36 0.90 -8.17 -4.64 1.00 1794 3694 ## life_satisfaction_between 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.04 1.00 1669 3526 ## life_satisfaction_within 0.00 0.01 -0.01 0.02 1.00 16724 9671 ## hu_life_satisfaction_between -0.05 0.13 -0.31 0.19 1.00 1651 3214 ## hu_life_satisfaction_within -0.15 0.25 -0.68 0.36 1.00 6065 7309 ## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## shape 5.33 0.11 5.12 5.55 1.00 6693 8054 ## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS).
